## Quiz Mode

Select an element (or it iterates through) and four multiple choice options
generated from available definitions are displayed; it tells you if you
identified what this element is correctly.


## Voiceover

Click an element to get a soothing spoken word reading of the definition from
the developer.


## Zoom in, zoom out

`<div id="greeting">Hello, world!</div>` can be selected in whole and described
as "a div element with one attribute and text contents", or you can zoom into
the scope and define the tag name (div), attributes (id="greeting") et al.
separately. Or you can zoom out to the div's parent tag.
